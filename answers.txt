Further questions:
1. How long approximately did it take you to do this lab?
    about 2 weeks

2. Do you feel like you gained an understanding of how to build a file system in this lab? Please suggest improvements.
    Through this lab, I gained an understanding of 
    how direct, indirect, and double indirect blocks are organized
    in the multi-level index structure.

    An improvement of the lab might be to be more explanatory on the errors 
    in stressfs.c. 
    Another improvement might be to add more comments in the 4 phases
    of the testing in stressfs.c.
